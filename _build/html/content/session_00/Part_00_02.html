<p>You may have thought of timed, written tests that were intended to sum up whatever you had learned over a course, the results of which determined setting and further study paths. Associated with these memories there may be feelings of anxiety or elation. As a successful learner you will have learned to cope with such assessments. You may have found them motivational. For those who find learning more difficult, or who had an off-day, however, assessment may impact on their self-confidence and
self-worth, as well as their attitude towards geography and towards school.</p>
<p>The purposes of assessment are discussed on the next page.</p>

<h4>2.1 Roles of assessment<a class="headerlink" href="#2.1-Roles-of-assessment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>More often than not, assessment in the past was done <strong>to</strong> students. Its main purpose was not to help improve learning; it was to find out what someone did – or did not – know. Learners were often simply given a mark or a brief comment (‘excellent’, ‘could do better’ and so on). Little help was given to learners regarding their particular difficulties or how they might improve their work. This is assessment of learning (AoL), which is also known as summative assessment.</p>
<p>The role of assessment in school today is thought about very differently – much emphasis is placed on assessment for learning (AfL, also known as formative assessment). Links between different types of assessment are summarised in Figure 1, and Table 1 distinguishes between AoL and AfL.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 1 is a complex diagram that shows planning, teaching and assessment as connected activities. It is read from left to right and includes several loops. The first box is ‘Assess pupils’ current knowledge and understanding’. The arrow leads to the next box on the right, which is ‘Planning’. An arrow straight down from this leads to ‘Teaching’. It is a double-headed arrow to indicate that planning and teaching inform each other. The teaching box has three other linked boxes; ‘continual assessment of pupils’ learning’, ‘internal test (e.g. end-of-topic test)’ and ‘external examination’. All these loop back to the planning box to indicate that assessment informs planning. Even tests are used to inform planning and teaching although the externally set examination remains as a final assessment." src="../../_images/pgce_geography_assessment_fig01.gif" /></p>

AfL approaches seek to avoid these pitfalls. The importance of AfL and the crucial role that it plays in enhancing teaching and learning is supported by a great deal of research. It is important to ensure that assessment is the servant of teaching and learning and not their master.</p>

<h2>Reflection point<a class="headerlink" href="#Reflection-point" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Can summative assessment be used formatively?</p>
<p>If assessment is to support learning, then how it is carried out is of prime importance. It is not simply what a teacher does but also how it is done that is important. To make AfL integral to learning try to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Identify what you want students to learn; use appropriate tasks and blend in activities that will allow AfL</strong> in terms of individuals’ techniques and skills, understanding of wider concepts and ability to apply their understanding in less familiar contexts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assess students as individuals</strong> as they learn at different rates; they learn different things from each other and from their experiences; and some develop misconceptions. Then teaching can be matched to needs of individuals. Include opportunities for students to respond to feedback.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Integrate continuous, systematic assessment into every lesson</strong> so that evidence is used to adapt teaching to meet learning needs – in this way it becomes AfL (Black et al., 2004, p. 10).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Assess the effectiveness of your teaching</strong>: use evidence about the effectiveness of the teaching decisions that you take (approaches, resources, tasks, activities, timings and so on) to inform modifications within lessons or sequences.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Without the process of adapting teaching and learning, the assessment is not formative – it is merely frequent.</p>

<p>While AoL has important roles to play in the education system, AfL can foster a sense of interdependence in the classroom and help to empower and engage students (Sidhu, 2011). In terms of how to assess, you need to have a long-term strategy to integrate AfL and AoL related to progression within the geography curriculum. Medium- and short-term assessment can then be devised to give all students the opportunity to demonstrate progress and give you the opportunity to respond to learners’ needs.</p>
